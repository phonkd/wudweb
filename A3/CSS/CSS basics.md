*Describes the visual style and presentation of the content written in HTML*

## Basic Theory:
*similar to html, there are also elements. Just many more and its a bit more complicated:* 

| Name | Purpose | note | Example value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  |
| selector | What html element to style | | h1 |
| Property | BRUH ||  font-size| 
| Value | Value of a property ||   20px |
| Declaration/stly | Property+value|   | font-size: 20px; |

**All together is a CSS rule**
